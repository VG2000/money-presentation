## Overview

This presentation explains:

1. **What money actually is** — 97% of UK money is commercial bank deposits, not physical cash
2. **How commercial banks create money** — through lending, not by intermediating deposits (debunking the "money multiplier" myth)
3. **How government spending works** — the Consolidated Fund mechanism and why spending is operationally money creation
4. **What taxation and debt issuance actually do** — taxation destroys money; debt issuance is a policy choice
5. **Real vs perceived constraints** — inflation and resources matter; "affordability" doesn't
