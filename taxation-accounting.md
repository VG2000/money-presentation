# Appendix C: Taxation Accounting

## Table 2: Accounting Transactions When Tax Is Paid

This table shows the step-by-step balance sheet changes when a UK taxpayer pays £100 in tax. Taxation is the reverse of spending — it **destroys money** rather than funding expenditure.

### Overview

When taxes are paid, money flows from the private sector back to government, ultimately crediting the Consolidated Fund. This extinguishes the money that was created when government originally spent.

### Step 1: Taxpayer Instructs Payment

A taxpayer with £100 in their bank account instructs their bank to pay HMRC.

| Entity | Assets | Liabilities |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Taxpayer** | −£100 (bank deposit) | −£100 (tax liability settled) |
| **Commercial Bank** | | −£100 (customer deposit) |

*The taxpayer's deposit disappears from the banking system.*

---

### Step 2: Commercial Bank Settles with Bank of England

The commercial bank's reserve account at the Bank of England is debited to settle the payment.

| Entity | Assets | Liabilities |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Commercial Bank** | −£100 (reserves at BoE) | |
| **Bank of England** | | −£100 (reserve liabilities) |
| **Bank of England** | | +£100 (HMRC account) |
| **HMRC Account at BoE** | +£100 | |

*Reserves are transferred from the commercial bank to HMRC's account at the Bank of England.*

### Step 3: HMRC Transfers to Consolidated Fund

HMRC transfers the receipt to the Consolidated Fund as required by the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act 1866, Section 10.

| Entity | Assets | Liabilities |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **HMRC Account** | −£100 | |
| **Consolidated Fund** | +£100 (credit) | |

---

### Step 4: End of Day — Exchequer Sweep

The Consolidated Fund credit offsets previous debits from spending, moving the net position toward zero (or surplus).

| Entity | Assets | Liabilities |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **National Loans Fund** | −£100 (reduced claim on CF) | |
| **Consolidated Fund** | | +£100 (improved net position) |

---

### Net Result

After £100 in tax is paid:

| Sector | Balance Sheet Change |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Taxpayer** | −£100 asset (bank deposit gone) |
| **Commercial Bank** | −£100 asset (reserves), −£100 liability (deposit) |
| **Bank of England** | −£100 net liability |
| **Government (consolidated)** | −£100 liability (money destroyed) |

**Key insight:** £100 of money has been destroyed. Taxation removes money from circulation — it is the reverse of spending, which creates money.

---

### Why Taxes Don't "Fund" Spending

The sequence matters:

1. **Government spends first** — creating new money via Consolidated Fund credit
2. **Taxes are paid later** — destroying money, crediting the CF
3. **Net position calculated at day's end** — the Exchequer Sweep reconciles

Taxes cannot logically "fund" spending because:

- The CF starts each day at zero
- Spending occurs via credit (balance sheet expansion)
- Tax receipts arrive throughout the day
- Settlement happens at day's end

The government doesn't wait to collect taxes before spending — it spends by creating credit, then taxes flow back to offset those credits.

### Analogy: The Stadium Ticket

Imagine a football club that issues its own tickets (currency) for entry. The club doesn't need to collect tickets before issuing them — it creates tickets, people use them to enter, then the club collects and destroys them at the gate.

Similarly:
- Government **issues** money (spending)
- Public **uses** money (transactions)  
- Government **collects and destroys** money (taxation)

The club can't "run out" of tickets. Nor can a currency-issuing government "run out" of its own money.
