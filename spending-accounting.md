# Appendix B: Government Spending Accounting

## Table 1: Accounting Transactions When Government Spends

This table shows the step-by-step balance sheet changes when Parliament authorizes £100 of expenditure and it flows to the private sector.

### Overview

When the UK government spends, money is created through balance sheet expansion. No pre-existing funds are required — the Consolidated Fund provides a sovereign line of credit backed by Parliament's taxing power.

---

### Step 1: Parliament Authorizes Expenditure

Parliament passes legislation (Supply and Appropriation Act or specific statute) authorizing £100 to be drawn from the Consolidated Fund.

*No balance sheet changes yet — this is legal authorization only.*

---

### Step 2: Treasury Requisition & Comptroller Grants Credit

HM Treasury raises a requisition. The Comptroller and Auditor General verifies Parliamentary authority and grants Treasury a "credit" on the Consolidated Fund.

| Entity | Assets | Liabilities |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Consolidated Fund** | | +£100 (credit to CF Supply Account) |
| **CF Supply Account** | +£100 (credit from CF) | |

*The CF account starts at zero but can go negative — this is the "growing produce of the Fund."*

---

### Step 3: Transfer to Departmental Account

Funds move from CF Supply Account to the spending department's account within the Government Banking Service.

| Entity | Assets | Liabilities |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **CF Supply Account** | −£100 | |
| **Departmental Account** | +£100 | |

*Internal transfer within government — no money created yet.*

---

### Step 4: Department Pays Recipient (e.g., NHS pays supplier)

The department instructs payment to a private sector recipient. This is where money enters the private sector.

| Entity | Assets | Liabilities |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Departmental Account** | −£100 | |
| **Paymaster General Account** | +£100 then −£100 | |
| **Bank of England** | | +£100 (commercial bank reserves) |
| **Commercial Bank** | +£100 (reserves at BoE) | +£100 (customer deposit) |
| **Recipient** | +£100 (bank deposit) | |

---

### Step 5: End of Day — Exchequer Sweep

At day's end, all Government Banking Service accounts are swept to zero. Net balances consolidate to the National Loans Fund.

| Entity | Assets | Liabilities |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Consolidated Fund** | | −£100 (net position) |
| **National Loans Fund** | +£100 (claim on CF) | |

---

### Net Result

After government spends £100:

| Sector | Balance Sheet Change |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Government (consolidated)** | +£100 liability (deposit/reserves created) |
| **Bank of England** | +£100 liability (reserves) |
| **Commercial Bank** | +£100 asset (reserves), +£100 liability (deposit) |
| **Private Sector Recipient** | +£100 asset (bank deposit) |

**Key insight:** £100 of new money now exists in the economy that didn't exist before. The government's "debt" is the private sector's financial asset.

---

### The "Growing Produce" Mechanism

The Finance Act 1954, Section 34(3) states:

> "Any sum charged by any Act, whenever passed, on the Consolidated Fund shall be charged also on **the growing produce of the Fund**"

This connects current spending to future tax revenues. Expenditure is credit advanced on the security of Parliament's power to tax — not spending of pre-collected taxes.
