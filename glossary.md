# Glossary of Key Terms

## Money Types

### Central Bank Money
Money issued by the Bank of England. Includes:
- **Currency** (banknotes and coins) — held by the public
- **Reserves** — deposits held by commercial banks at the Bank of England

### Commercial Bank Money
Deposits in commercial bank accounts. Created when banks make loans. Comprises approximately 97% of UK broad money.

### Broad Money
The total money supply in the economy, including both currency and bank deposits. Measured by aggregates like M4.

## UK Government Institutions

### Consolidated Fund (CF)
The central government account established in 1787. All authorized expenditure originates from the CF, and most revenue flows into it. Functions as a sovereign line of credit backed by Parliament's taxing power.

### National Loans Fund (NLF)
Handles government borrowing and lending operations. Receives the net balance from the daily Exchequer Sweep.

### Contingencies Fund
A fund (maximum £2 billion) for urgent expenditure when Parliament is not sitting. Must be repaid from subsequent Supply votes.

### Debt Management Account (DMA)
Operated by the Debt Management Office (DMO) for daily cash management operations.

### Government Banking Service (GBS)
The banking infrastructure providing accounts for government departments, operated within the commercial banking sector but with special arrangements through the Paymaster General Account.

### Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG)
Head of the National Audit Office. Must verify Parliamentary authority before granting Treasury a "credit" on the Consolidated Fund. An essential constitutional safeguard.

## Bank of England Terms

### Reserves
Deposits held by commercial banks in their accounts at the Bank of England. Used for settlement between banks and with government.

### Ways and Means Accounts
Overdraft facilities that allow Treasury to borrow from the Bank of England. The original Ways and Means account was frozen at £370 million due to Maastricht Treaty constraints; a second facility (Ways and Means II) was created as a workaround.

### Sterling Monetary Framework
The Bank of England's system for implementing monetary policy, managing reserves, and providing liquidity to the banking sector.

### Floor System
Post-2009 monetary policy framework where the Bank of England holds large quantities of reserves (from QE) and pays interest on all reserves at Bank Rate. Contrasts with the pre-2009 "corridor" system.

### Corridor System
Pre-2009 monetary policy framework where the BoE targeted a specific quantity of reserves to maintain the interbank rate. Required active management of reserve levels through debt issuance and money market operations.

## Policy Terms

### Full Funding Rule
The convention that government must issue debt (gilts) equal to its borrowing requirement. A policy choice, not an operational necessity.

### Quantitative Easing (QE)
Bank of England purchases of government bonds (gilts) from the private sector, creating new reserves. Effectively reverses government debt issuance.

### Gilt
UK government bonds — debt securities issued by the Debt Management Office.

### Exchequer Sweep
The daily process where all Government Banking Service accounts are swept to zero, with net balances consolidated into the National Loans Fund.

---

## Accounting Terms

### Balance Sheet Expansion
Creating new assets and liabilities simultaneously, increasing the size of a balance sheet. How both commercial banks (lending) and government (spending) create money.

### T-Account
A simplified accounting format showing assets on the left and liabilities on the right. Used to illustrate balance sheet changes.

### Standing Services
Government expenditures permanently authorized by specific Acts of Parliament (e.g., debt interest payments). Don't require annual votes.

### Supply Services
Government expenditures authorized through annual Supply and Appropriation Acts passed by Parliament.

---

## Economic Concepts

### Money Multiplier
The textbook theory that banks "multiply up" central bank reserves into deposits. The Bank of England explicitly states this is not how money creation works in reality.

### Intermediation
The idea that banks act as intermediaries between savers and borrowers. Another misconception — banks create deposits when lending, rather than lending out existing deposits.

### Reflux
The return of money to its issuer. For commercial banks, loan repayment destroys the deposits that lending created. For government, taxation destroys the money that spending created.

### Hierarchy of Money
The concept that different forms of money exist in a hierarchy of acceptability. Government money (backed by taxing power) sits at the top; commercial bank money is convertible into government money on demand.
